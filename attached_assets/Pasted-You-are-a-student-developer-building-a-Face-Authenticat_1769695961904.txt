You are a student developer building a Face Authentication Attendance System for a university assignment.

Build a complete Python-based project with the following requirements:

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The system must:

Register a user's face using a real webcam

Identify the face using live camera input

Mark attendance as:

Punch-in

Punch-out

Work in real-time with a webcam

Handle basic lighting variation

Include basic spoof prevention (eye blink OR head movement detection)

TECH STACK (must use)

Python 3

OpenCV

face_recognition library

SQLite or CSV for attendance storage

Do NOT train any deep learning model manually. Use pretrained models from face_recognition.

MODULE BEHAVIOR
register_face.py

Open webcam

Ask user for name

Capture face image

Save image in faces/ folder

Store face encoding

recognize_face.py

Load stored face encodings

Open webcam

Detect face

Match with registered users

Ask whether:
1 = Punch in
2 = Punch out

Save timestamp in attendance.csv

spoof_check.py

Implement basic spoof detection using:

Eye blink detection OR

Head movement detection

Reject static images

ATTENDANCE FORMAT (CSV)

Name, Date, Time, Status

Example:
Rahul, 2026-01-29, 09:10:22, Punch-in

README.md CONTENT (IMPORTANT)

Generate a full README.md written like a student project report including:

1. Project Overview

Explain the problem and purpose

2. Model and Approach Used

Explain:

Face detection

Face encoding (128-d embeddings)

Matching using Euclidean distance

3. Training Process

Explain that pretrained model is used and faces are registered instead of training

4. Accuracy Expectations

Mention:

Good lighting: 90–95%

Poor lighting: 70–80%

5. Spoof Prevention Method

Explain blink or movement detection

6. Known Failure Cases

List:

Low light

Twins

Printed photo

Mask

7. How to Run

Give step-by-step instructions:

pip install requirements

run register_face.py

run recognize_face.py

8. Evaluation Criteria Mapping

Explain how system satisfies:

Functional accuracy

Reliability

ML limitations

Practical quality

STYLE REQUIREMENTS

Code must be simple

Variable names readable

Comments written like a student

No enterprise-level complexity

No cloud deployment

Local webcam only

No UI frameworks

OUTPUT FORMAT

Generate:

Full code for each file

requirements.txt

Full README.md

Clear separation of files

No placeholders

No missing logic

IMPORTANT

This must look like:
✔ A college ML project
✔ Not a corporate system
✔ Simple, understandable, and practical
✔ Meets assignment rubric exactly
